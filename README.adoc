= Trying to Make 3D Models More Interoperable
:hardbreaks-option:

**STF** is a work-in-progress **modular 3D interchange format** for (not only) games-development use-cases.

See **https://stfform.at[stfform.at]** or the pinned repositories below.

I'm frustrated with the lack of interoperability for 3D assets, especially in open source.
This is my attempt to develop an open and extensible alternative to FBX.

STF doesn't replace glTF or USD. These formats exist for different use-cases and do not compete with STF.

Aside from that, I make 3d Avatars for VR applications like VRChat and VSeeFace.
